# PySideExample
Creating an app from scratch can be really depressing, especially if you’re as lazy as I am. So, in order to make my life (and yours) more enjoyable when building stuff, I’ve made templates for basic uses of the PySide6 library. These include buttons, labels, and lots of other elements with simple examples.  
The repo is divided into two sections:
* Qt elements and explanations on how to use them
* Examples showing how those Qt elements are used in code

## Features

* Basic Qt elemnts such as label, buttons, image and so on
* basic example of these elemtents in use
* basics procedures that can be used with these elements (When something is clik, hover, ...)


## Installation

### 1. Create a virtual environment (recommended):

```bash
python -m venv venv
.\venv\Scripts\activate  # Windows
source venv/bin/activate  # Linux/Mac
```

### 2. Install dependencies:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```
or 
```bash
pip install requests
pip install PySide6
```

### 3. Do whatever you want

I really mean it, you can copy-paste the code with a well used ```ctrl+c``` and  ```ctrl+v```, modify the code or even entirely rewrite it, I dont care. Feel free to make anithing with it (if its ilegal or could get me in trouble, just dont say that you get the templates from me).  
I hope that you will have more fun using my code tahn you or me writing it and if you fing any mistakes, contact me.
